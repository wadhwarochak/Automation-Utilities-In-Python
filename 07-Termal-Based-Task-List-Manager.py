 Challenge: Terminal-Based Task List Manager

Create a Python script that lets users manage a to-do list directly from the terminal.

Your program should:
1. Allow users to:
   - Add a task
   - View all tasks
   - Mark a task as completed
   - Delete a task
   - Exit the app
2. Save all tasks in a text file named `tasks.txt` so data persists between runs.
3. Display tasks with an index number and a ✔ if completed.

Example menu:
1. Add Task
2. View Tasks
3. Mark Task as Completed
4. Delete Task
5. Exit

Example output:
Your Tasks:

Buy groceries||not_done
Finish Python project||done
Read a || book||not_done


Bonus:
- Prevent empty tasks from being added
- Validate task numbers before completing/deleting
